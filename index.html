<body>

	<h1>Lila's top 10 best British 'foods' (in order with reasons).</h1>
	<h5>I have no qualifications but these are my opinions - hope y'all enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h5>
    <ol> 
		<li>
			<p>'A cuppa'</p>
			<p>Acceptable in any scenario. Instant fix for a bad mood. Just a generally succulent beverage. </p>

		</li>
		<li> 
			<p>Beans on toast</p>
			<p>Optional cheese. On a disgustingly buttery piece of sourdough its a dream.</p>

		</li>

        <li> 
			<p>Sunday lunch (roast)</p>
			<p>A classic. Chicken, roast potatoes, pigs in blankets, carrots, spinach, gravy. MMMMM.</p>
            <img src="sundaylunch.webp" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>

		<li> 
			<p>Sausage rolls</p>
			<p> A go-to. Either as a snack or part of a meal they never fail to make me happy (unless they have nuts in them).</p>
            <img src="sausagerolls.webp" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>



		<li> 
			<p>Bangers and mash</p>
			<p>With some steaming gravy. Bit of a comfort meal.</p>
            <img src="bangers.webp" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>



		<li> 
			<p>Chicken Pie</p>
			<p>Got to have both wholegrain mustard and ketchup to make it worthwhile.</p>
            <img src="chickenpie.webp" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>



		<li> 
			<p>Cottage/Shepherd's Pie</p>
			<p> Another comfort meal. Again, ketchup is a must have.</p>
            <img src="cottagepie.webp" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>




		<li>
			<p>Victoria sponge cake</p>
			<p>Only this low because often the cream to jam ratio isn't right. Ya gotta be heavy on the jam and icing sugar on the top.</p>
            <img src="viccy.webp" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>
		
		
		<li> 
			<p>Fish and chips</p>
			<p>Don't actually love fish but when it's good it's SO good.</p>
            <img src="fishnchips.jpg" width="200" height="200" >
		</li>


		
		<li> 
			<p>Scone</p>
			<p>Not sure how I feel about scones. Again, you've got to get the jam to cream ratio right otherwise they're too dry. But it's a no no if they have raisins.</p>
            <img src=scone.jpg width="200" height="200" >
